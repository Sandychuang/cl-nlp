## NLP for common lisp

The following system libraries are required to use this package:

 * kyotocabinet
 * wordnet 3.0
 * r-base
 * ed
 * graphviz
 * libstemmer-dev
 * libstemmer-tools
 * libstemmer0d

Lisp library dependencies that are not available via quicklisp are in the
lib/ directory

This version supports English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian.

Pre-trained data sets are available at http://nyx.chatsubo.net/~raison/languages.tar.gz

I can make the various corpora available for retraining on an as-needed basis.
